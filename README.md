### Win Library Tool

This tool provides the following features not available in Windows:

* Add network (UNC or mapped drive) and any other un-indexed folders to libraries.
* Backup library configuration, such that a saved set of libraries can be instantly restored at any point.
* Create a mirror of all libraries (using symbolic links) in [SystemDrive]:\libraries.
* Change a library's icon.
